    "\n",
    "## 4.1 Structural elements\n",
    "- Flask is slightly \"opinionated\" (~= \"This is how it should be done\"). It has several expectations but those can be overridden.\n",
    "  - The application is expected to be in a package folder. If your application is called **flasky**, under the **flasky** folder you should have an `__init__.py` file. This makes ot a package. This will also be the first file Flask executes, so initialization steps are typically part of the script.   \n",
    "  - `from flask import Flask, ...` - it is usually the first line in a scipt that executes Flask code.   \n",
    "  - `app = Flask(__name__)` - FLASK_APP = (package). The `app` variable is a convention to store the Flask application object. The `__name__` init argument assigns the script nem to the app; Flask processes it correctly. You have a couple of options to specify which app to run, but one of the easiest is to use the FLASK_APP environment variable, and use the package name.   \n",
    "  - `@app.route()` - this decorator is provided to connect a URL route to a view function.   \n",
    "  - `flask run` - this is the default way to start the app. It will find the script if it is called `app.py`, `wsgi.py` or if you used FLASK_APP, otherwise you can start it with the --app switch: `flask --app appname run`   \n",
    "  - templates can be used to assemble HTML content, if your backend sends back an HTML response. The template engine used by Flask is Jinja2. It can do some variable interpolation, some python code evaluation etc, some template combination, so the end result is quite flexibly handled by the backend.   \n",
    "  - the templates are expected to be stored in the package at the /templates folder.    \n",
    "  - the /static folder is expected to store static elements. (css, images, js, ...).     \n",
    "- extensions are available from the community to expand the capabilities of Flask. Some are:   \n",
    "  - SQLAlchemy (ORM), flask-login, flask-wtforms\n",
    "\n",
    "During development time, we run Flask on our development machine.   \n",
    "Flask provides a simple web application server, the development server. It is not so secure and not so robust, so it is not meant to run the production code.   \n",
